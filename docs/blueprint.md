# **App Name**: OctaView

Let's start building the OctaView app using Next.js and Material UI. For the backend, it will be in firebase firestore and python cloud functions.
Goal: Set up the basic Next.js project structure with Material UI integration and necessary backend file layouts.. 
First we create a landing page. OctaView is a responsive web app that allow enterprises connect their security cameras and using AI it will detect the things the users/entriprises need to get alerts on. For example for retail stores, it will give if there is any robbery, theft or assaults, for warehouses, it can send which places are open. And for factory floors it can tell if the users are wearing saftety equipments. It all depends on the prompt you give it.
Also I will now attach a mockup of the sign up.. If you can create a landing page with images and color combination that aligns well. It would be cooll!!
